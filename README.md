This app is a work in progress. It is an app that shows pictures of animals and the sounds they make.

Very entertaining for kids at the ages of 1-3.

Parents who want to show their chilren different animals and the sounds they make, should try it :)

Currently it is for demonstration purposes only and it is set for devices using hdpi displays. Preferably 800x480.

Main programming features are:

ViewPager | Fragments | MediaPlayer | View Animations
