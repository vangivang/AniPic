AniPic
======

This app is a work in progress. It is an app that shows pictures of animals and the sounds they make. Very entertaining for kids at the age of 3. Parents who want to show their chilren different animals and the sounds they make, should try it :)

Currently it is for demonstration purposes only and it is set for devices using hdpi displays. Preferably 800x480.

Main programming features are:

ViewPager | Fragments | MediaPlayer | View Animations

An APK was added to this directory if you care to try the app on an appropriate device (resolution wise).
